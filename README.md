# fastai 2019 pt2 notes

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is my “speedrunning” attempt to see how far I can get in [Deep
Learning from the Foundations](https://course19.fast.ai) before the new
course begins.

This repo contains annotated notes – in my own special format – that are
then hosted live on the docs where they make much more sense!

This special format for right now is propritary, but you can easily
grasp that it utilizes nbdev to achieve what I was trying to do. If you
want a challenge, try to recreate what I made with nbdev v2 (something
this isn’t) and force me to reveal my secrets ;) Otherwise they shall
remain a (mild) secret until I’ve ported them myself and I feel the time
is right.

But, tl;dr:

- This is a 1:1 followthrough of the **videos** in Deep Learning from
  the Foundations, taken in October of 2022.
- As a result any issues with the course will have been explored and
  rectified in these notes
- These notes are **best viewed live** directly on
  https://muellerzr.github.io/fastai-2019-pt2-notes, though the
  notebooks can still be useful!
